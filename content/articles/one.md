I talk too much, and I write too little. I started my current "dry period" as all of my previous, I let myself belief that the struggles of everyday life must be absent completely for me to focus on a creative task; or to stay focused for any definite amount of time. 

I find myself angry lately. I'm angry with a large portion of the world, the country; all manner of large and small things. 

I'm not sure, really, if all of these things (or things like them) have existed my whole life, but yet I've somehow remained oblivious to them. If that's the case, then I am the source of my own issues. I have a vague memory of a quote that goes something like, "Adulthood is slowly discovering all the things that limit your potential". I think that's probably an accurate illustration of how I feel right now.

Maybe I'm just over-thinking this. That's a habit of mine. I've just gotten to a point where I feel as if I'm going to explode if I don't write it down or say. It's largely the driving force behind why I talk so much. I talk, and I talk, and I say very little. 

Art has largely become a disconnect for me. I can manage to gather the energy to actually build things from a development end. Its much like me as a child, playing with legoes. My problem now is that visual things I can't do. I can't focus. I made a large degree of head-way on the dezby site a few weeks ago, but I can't manage to commit to **anything**. 

That's my issue, I want to be a part of so much, but I get afraid of being trapped, or committed somehow. Once I'm in something I feel this overwhelming weight on myself and it seems to drive me to such a point of stress that I do one of two things.

1. Rush through blindly
2. Get out any way possible

I don't want to be **that** guy. I don't. I feel like I'm constantly fighting a battle between who I want to be and who I actually am. I want to be a successfully driven creative. I want to be someone who churns out wonderful ideas (completed ideas). 

I want to be someone who *ships*.

I want to be someone who people respect, not out of ego, but so that I can help share what I know. I want to teach, I want to be respected for what I know and can do, so I can help create sparks in other creatives' minds.
