## Emergency Design Kit

Startup just get into YC Summer Camp? Fast approaching a hard deadline? Need a lack of bullshit, and hard & fast results?

My friend, you've come to the right place. This here is what we call the Emergency Design Kit. 

You can have it fast, you can have it cheap, or you can have it great. 

Please pick two:

[]I want it Fast!
[]I want it Cheap!
[]I want it Great!

Why can't I have all three?

Because a fully rounded, effective project requires ample time and ample budget, without those two you can't get an earth shattering design.

…but sometimes you don't need earth-shattering, you just need to ship. 

That's where this kit comes in, it will help you ship faster and use the power of iterative design once the project is out to keep working towards the quality you strive for.

A few things to keep in mind:

Know this going in:

_You will have to make compromises._ 
The house is on fire, and you've got less than a min. to get out, what do you take with you?

_You may pay more._
Time is money, but not all time is created equal. Three hours spent on concept development is not the same as three hours spent on concept development, prototypes, development, & testing.

_Things will move fast_
…and within reason. This also means if you get sent a revision to provide feedback on, the clock it ticking.
