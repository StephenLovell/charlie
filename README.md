==================

A simple, no DB cms using [mustache][1] & [markdown][2].

## To Do (Bugs, Issues)
* Template is inherited on 404 errors for post pages (which results in tweet footer).

## Roadmap (Features, Dreams, Wishes)
* Add draft ability. Files with draft_ prepended are ignored and not accessible.
* Fully functional info handler
* Add hooks to inject at certain points. (info handler ?)
* Page Caching
* Dropbox integration w/ content folder.
* Add .js pagination to core.
* Add optional feed formats (rss, xml,â€¦)
* Create default theme with informational default content.
* Proper OOP overhaul


## Done
* [X] Proper 404 handling (pass back to index.php via .htaccess)
* [X] Add template_part() function (already there, doh!)
* [X] Page Content Object (with variable parsing?)
* [X] Add template language - mustache
* [X] Agnostic Loop function (diet WP loop)
* [X] Image Handling
* [X] Change Post Array sorting to something other than alphabetical by filename.
* [X] Sterilize everything from core and move into stephencreates.com or some such.
* [X] Make Feed Looper themeable with mustache parts (load feed object)
* [X] Add Post Dates as parts of file titles? (other ideas?) (used frontmatter as solution)
* [X] Update Feed Loop to match regular Content Looper. (merged into single looper)
* [X] More OOP and Class usage, omit orphaned functions or group into master toolbox class.
* [X] Reorg directory structure.
* [X] Feed Dates are wrong
* [X] Needs a license.
