==================

A simple, lightweight, no db cms with a templating system.

## To Do

* [X]	Add template_part() function (already there, doh!)
* 		Add draft ability. Files with draft_ prepended are ignored and not accessible.
* 		Fully functional info handler
* 		Page Content Object (with variable parsing?)
* 		Image Handling
* 		Agnostic Loop function (diet WP loop)
* [X]	Proper 404 handling (pass back to index.php via .htaccess)
